    <h2>Pipes Angular</h2>
    <p> Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates,
        and other data for display. Pipes are simple functions
        you can use in template expressions to accept an input
        value and return a transformed value. Pipes are useful
        because you can use them throughout your application,
        while only declaring each pipe once. For example, you
        would use a pipe to show a date as April 15, 1988 rather
        than the raw string format.
